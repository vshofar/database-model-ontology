- use known facts and inferences for then provides a way to validae ontology class and property description.
    - these samples algo can be used as "unit tests" in the form of queries wich answers are previouly known.
    - these queries cane bem reexecuted to validate if ontology has desarisde bahavior for inferences

- prefer use on inference to classify known instance classes
    - using property with defined domain and range can improve instances classification
    - use os disjoint statement also helps detect ontology inconsistency

- some modeling in fol can have alternatives modeling using dl
    - the domain describes a relation betwenn the type o entity (strong or weak) and the concept of 'partial keys'
    - in fol we explict declare when a entity is weak and infer partial keys
    - in owl otherwise use declare partial keys using the relation 'hasPartialKey' and use it to infer weak entityes
    - it looks to be the better alternative to addres the initial requirement of using relations to declare facts ans infer class instances

- not declaring tha two individuals are diferent can create duplicated axioms    
- when executinig swrl reasonig, we must wonder that the facts must be considered as true before reasonig
    - this way, some assertion can be evaluated as true, after execute reasoning more tha one time !!!
- query ontolofy througn owlready api 2 afer run reasoner does not give the same result as query reasoner
